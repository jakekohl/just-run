# just-run
Host the codebase for the [TO BE NAMED] app

# Background

## Origin Story
I was not very satisfied that there is a simple trainingpeaks like competitor that is outside of the main wearable ecosystems for running, so I am building my own that doesn't cost as much as trainingpeaks does.

## Current Features
Just getting started
